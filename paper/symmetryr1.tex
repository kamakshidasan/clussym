\abstract{
The complexity in visualizing volumetric data often limits the scope of direct exploration
of scalar fields. Isocontours are quite popular in analysing the characteristics
of scalar field data because of its simplicity in presenting features in the data. 
In this paper, we present a novel representation of contours in a scalar field with 
the aim of studying the similarity relationship between the contours. The representation 
maps contours as points in a high-dimensional transformation-invariant descriptor space. 
We leverage the power of this representation to design a clustering based algorithm for 
detecting symmetric regions in a scalar field. Symmetry detection is a challenging problem 
because it demands both segmentation of the data and identification of transformation 
invariant segments. While the former task can be addressed using topological analysis of 
scalar fields, the latter requires geometry based solutions. Our approach combines the two 
by utilizing the contour tree for segmenting the data and the descriptor space for 
identifying transformation invariance. We show the effectiveness of our method in 
designing applications like query driven exploration and asymmetry visualization.

\firstsection{Introduction}
\maketitle
Many scientific experiments and simulations generate scalar field data that
contain symmetric or repeating patterns. In many disciplines, 
symmetry plays an important role in studying the underlying scientific phenomena. 
For example, in crystallography, symmetry information is used to determine 
the structure of a crystal~\cite{som07}. In product design, symmetry is important 
to ensure functional efficiency and optimal manufacturing cost~\cite{booth02}. Symmetry is a 
useful cue in biology for determining growth and development of organs~\cite{stev06}. Since 
the study of symmetric features is of great interest in scientific data 
analysis, the problem of detecting symmetry in scalar fields has received 
considerable attention among researchers in the recent past~\cite{ThomN11,HongS08,kerbWKS11,ThomN13,MasoodTN13}.

Automatic detection of symmetry in scalar fields is a challenging problem and 
the quest for a widely applicable, efficient, and robust method for symmetry 
detection is ongoing. Though symmetry detection in scalar
fields is a relatively new area of research, the problem of detecting symmetry
in shapes has been well studied in the geometry processing community.
These studies have established that clustering based analyses result in superior
performance in robust identification of symmetry. Some of these clustering methods
have been extended to scalar fields and they operate by determining symmetry
transformations through aggregation of local symmetry of sample points of the
domain. Scalar field datasets are typically represented using scalar values 
assigned to a discrete set of sample points that represent the domain under 
consideration. However, the domain and the scalar values are assumed to be continuous by
interpolating the values at the sample points. Therefore, the sample points in a scalar 
field capture the lowest level of information. In practice, scientists are more interested
in higher level features, extracted through methods like segmentation and isosurface extraction,
for studying the underlying physical phenomena. Hence, symmetry detection methods that are based on 
local information available at the sample points face considerable difficulty in representing 
and extracting meaningful symmetric regions. Moreover, these methods are computationally 
expensive since the number of sample points in scalar field datasets is typically orders of magnitude
higher than that in geometric shape datasets.

Though it is clear from methods proposed in the geometry processing community
that a clustering based analysis offers significant advantages in detecting symmetry,
we believe that unlike shapes, low-level information available at the sample points of the 
domain is not suited for symmetry detection in scalar fields. In this work, we propose 
a novel symmetry detection method based on the idea of clustering contours. Isosurfaces
are extensively used in studying scalar field datasets and contours capture information 
about a scalar field at a macroscale as opposed to sample points of the domain. Therefore, they
are more suitable for a clustering based analysis. It is easy to see that contours
belonging to regions with symmetric scalar field distribution are also symmetric. Using an 
appropriate shape descriptor, our method maps contours to points in a descriptor space 
such that the distance between points in the descriptor space is a measure of similarity 
between the contours. As a result, points in the descriptor space 
representing symmetric contours lie in close 
proximity to each other and form clusters in the descriptor space. The region of the domain
corresponding to each such contour can be extracted and these regions
are reported as symmetric as illustrated in Figure~\ref{teaser}. Note that the choice
of the shape descriptor is not fixed and depending on the noise characteristics and the definition
of similarity relevant to the application of interest, an appropriate descriptor may be used.

The main contributions of this paper are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A formulation of the problem of symmetry detection in scalar fields
as a clustering problem in a shape descriptor space. This model
provides a lot of flexibility in analysing similarity of scalar fields
as well as handling noise since it allows the shape representation and the 
descriptor space to be varied.
\item A novel representation of contours as points in a contour descriptor space.
Similarity between contours is naturally defined as the distance between points 
in this space. This is a generic representation of independent interest 
and we show its benefit in similarity analysis of scalar fields.
\item A robust algorithm to detect symmetric regions at multiple scales. Though geometry based 
symmetry detection methods are typically computationally costly, we design an efficient algorithm 
that employs elegant optimisations by incorporating topological information 
about the contours using the contour tree.
\item Applications to query driven exploration and asymmetry visualization.
\end{itemize}
Symmetry information in scalar fields
has been used for transfer function design, exploration of isosurfaces, selection of cross-section
planes and view directions, linked selection and editing, query driven exploration,
and visualization of features through dual rendering~\cite{ThomN11,HongS08,ThomN13,MasoodTN13}.
We believe that as better techniques for robust detection of symmetry in scalar fields are developed,
many more applications will emerge.
\section{Related Work}
Existing symmetry detection methods in scalar fields can be broadly classified into two
categories, namely, geometry based methods and topology based methods. We briefly review
these methods in this section.
\subsection{Geometry based approaches}
Several methods have been proposed in the literature for detecting
symmetry in shapes and these methods are described in a survey paper by
Mitra~et~al.~\cite{MitPWC2012}. Some of these methods~\cite{Mitra06,KazhdanCDFR03,BokBWSS09} have 
been applied to scalar fields~\cite{MasoodTN13,HongS08,kerbWKS11}, however they struggle to address 
the challenges in extending geometric methods to scalar fields.
Scalar field datasets are significantly larger in size and hence symmetry detection is computationally costly.
Geometric methods typically consider geometric information derived from a small region around each sample
point of the domain for symmetry detection. Directly applying this approach to scalar field makes it difficult 
to capture important features in a scalar field leading to poor performance in extracting higher level
features and handling of noise in the data.
Moreover, the scalar values are assumed to be continuous over the domain by interpolating the values at 
the discrete set of sample points. Therefore, inspecting only local information at the sample points
introduces additional challenges due to discretization errors since the symmetric counterpart for a 
given point may be an interpolated point.

Hong and Shen~\cite{HongS08} propose a method to detect global reflective symmetry by identifying planes
of reflection that minimize the difference between the scalar value at a point and its
reflection. This method is computationally inefficient and cannot be easily extended to detect 
other types of symmetry. Kerber~et~al.~\cite{kerbWKS11} build a graph network of crease line features in a dataset
and detect symmetry by computing geometric transformations that match subgraphs within the crease line network.
Since only a small subset of features in scalar field datasets contain crease lines, 
this method is not very useful in practice. Masood~et~al.~\cite{MasoodTN13} detect
symmetry by identifying symmetry transformations as clusters in the space of all transformations.
The clusters are generated by aggregating local symmetry transformations of pairs of points in the 
domain. This method relies on local signatures of sample points for determining 
transformations and as a result several parameters need to be tweaked at various stages of 
the symmetry detection pipeline to limit the adverse effects of variations in the local signatures 
and discretization errors.  Moreover, the transformation space is often cluttered with a lot of 
spurious transformations and introduces artifacts in the extraction of symmetric regions.
The above methods compute geometric transformations between candidate pairs for identifying
symmetry and are computationally costly. Moreover, they are driven by purely local geometric 
measures and therefore do not incorporate any criterion to recognize important features. Hence, they consider every 
candidate pair, including pairs corresponding to noise, to be equally important in their analysis. 
Our method, on the other hand, uses topological information derived from the contour tree to infer 
importance of a feature and this allows the design of a feature-aware algorithm for symmetry detection. 

Bruckner~et~al. propose an information theoretic approach for isosurface similarity 
detection~\cite{BrucknerM10,haidacher11}. This method uses mutual information of distance 
transforms to quantify the information common to two isosurfaces and build a similarity map 
between all pairs of isosurfaces. Clusters with high mutual information is used to detect 
similar isosurfaces within and across datasets. Although closely related to our method, 
by virtue of using distance transforms as the descriptor, 
this method identifies similar family of isosurfaces within a range of isovalues that 
form an onion-peel like layered arrangement. Our method, on the other hand, is more suited 
for identifying partial similarities and extracting symmetric regions by identifying
similarity between contours and not isosurfaces. While the isosurface similarity map based
method is limited to analysing similarity between
datasets only in pairs, the descriptor space can be used to analyse multiple datasets simultaneously.
Similarity between different scalar fields has also been studied by measuring the extent of overlap
between contours~\cite{SchneiderWCHS08,schn13}. The distance transform
descriptor and the overlap between contours are affected by changes in orientation
whereas our method is not tied to a particular choice of descriptor. Based on the requirements of 
the application under consideration, our method  can be adapted to be sensitive or 
insensitive to orientation. 
\subsection{Topology based methods}
Thomas and Natarajan propose topology based methods for symmetry detection and these methods 
are computationally efficient because they operate on graph representations of the scalar field
like the contour tree~\cite{ThomN11} and the extremum graph~\cite{ThomN13}. The contour tree based method 
assumes that the subtrees of the contour tree corresponding to symmetric regions are structurally
similar. They detect symmetry by evaluating structural similarity between the subtrees using a 
similarity score that measures the overlap between the branches of the trees. 
This method can find symmetry at multiple scales but cannot handle
noise that destroy the repeating structure of the subtrees. The extremum 
graph based method selects a set of extrema called seed set and 
estimates distances robustly through a graph traversal procedure. A carefully chosen distance 
threshold is used to disconnect the graph and classify the seeds into different groups called 
super-seeds. A region growing procedure is then used to identify the symmetric region 
corresponding to each super-seed. This procedure makes a strong assumption that the symmetric regions
can be identified purely from the proximity relationship between the seeds. Hence,
it relies heavily on a meaningful selection of seed set which involves significant effort 
and understanding about the symmetry of the domain. In addition, this method requires several thresholds

		symmetric contours shown in orange colour are mapped to six points which lie in close

to be set.

The above methods being topological in nature do not ensure that the regions detected by
them are indeed geometrically symmetric while our method being geometric in nature, 
ensures that the regions detected are symmetric. Moreover, current methods compare candidate regions 
pairwise and rely on a similarity threshold to classify them into symmetric groups. Determining
the similarity threshold is a challenge when using datasets with varying characteristics.
Clustering based analysis avoids the need for pairwise comparisons. Instead, the symmetric regions
are directly obtained as clusters in the descriptor space. 
Similarity between scalar fields have been
studied in the context of shape matching applications by using graph matching methods on 
discrete approximations of the contour tree~\cite{ZhangBKDNB06,HilagaSKK01}.
The contour tree provides metadata information about the contours
and allows integration of topological information in geometric processing. Thus, by utilizing 
the descriptor space to capture geometric information about contours along with the power of contour 
tree as a topological abstraction of contours, our method offers significant advantages over

existing symmetry detection methods. 
\section{Definitions}
Consider a \emph{scalar field}, $f : \mathbb{M}  \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, defined on a 
simply connected domain $\mathbb{M}$. The preimage of $f$ for a given value $u \in \mathbb{R}$, 
$f^{-1}(u)$, is called a \emph{level set} of $f$. A level set may have multiple components
and each component is called a \emph{contour}. Consider a sweep of the domain using level sets in the order
of increasing function values. A contour is created at a \emph{minimum}, may merge
with another contour or split into different contours at a \emph{saddle}, and is destroyed
at a \emph{maximum}. The \emph{contour tree} is a topological 
data structure that captures these changes in the connectivity of the level sets, see Figure~\ref{ct}.
Let $R$ be an equivalence relation defined on points in $\mathbb{M}$: $xRy$ for $x,y 
\in \mathbb{M}$  if $x,y$ belong to the same contour. The contour tree is the quotient space 
induced by this relation. 

Subdomains $\mathbb{M}_1, \mathbb{M}_2 \subseteq \mathbb{M}$ are said to be \emph{symmetric} 
if there is a transformation $T$ such that ${\mathbb{M}_2=T(\mathbb{M}_1)}$ and 
${f(x)=f(T(x))}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{M}_1$. If $c_1$ and $c_2$ are contours of the same level
set that belong to $\mathbb{M}_1$ and $\mathbb{M}_2$ respectively, it is easy to see that if 
$\mathbb{M}_1$ and $\mathbb{M}_2$ are symmetric then $c_1$ and $c_2$ are also symmetric. 
We make use of this property and detect symmetric subdomains by identifying symmetry of the 
contours belonging to the subdomains. The above definition of symmetry requires computation of the symmetry 
transformation $T$, which is a costly operation. Therefore, we use an alternate definition of symmetry.
Let $\mathbb{C}$ be the set of all contours. 
Consider a function $g : \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $g(c) = g(T(c))$
where $T$ is a transformation. In other words, $g$ is a function that maps each
contour to a point in a high-dimensional space, called a \emph{descriptor}, 
such that a contour and its symmetric copies are mapped to the same point, see Figure~\ref{ctmap}.
For illustration, the descriptor space is shown in 2D but the actual dimension of the space
depends on the choice of the descriptor. We call this high-dimensional space the
\emph{descriptor space} and the distance between contours in the descriptor space is a
measure of their similarity. In practice, scalar field datasets do not exhibit perfect symmetry and therefore
it is important to detect symmetry in an approximate sense. Ideally, deviation
from perfect symmetry should be measured in the space of shapes but 
it is more convenient to measure deviations in the descriptor space. If contours $c_1$ and 
$c_2$ deviate from perfect symmetry, then $c_1$ and $c_2$ will not be mapped
to the same point in the descriptor space and the distance between
them in the descriptor space, $\lVert g(c_1)-g(c_2) \rVert$, will be indicative
\begin{defi}
Contours $c_1$ and $c_2$ are perfectly symmetric if $\lVert g(c_1)-g(c_2) \rVert = 0$,
where $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ is a norm in the descriptor space. They are 
{$\epsilon$-symmetric} if $\lVert g(c_1)-g(c_2) \rVert \leq \epsilon$.
\end{defi}
of the deviation from perfect symmetry. 

Shape descriptors have been extensively used in the
geometry processing community for shape matching and there is a
vast collection of research papers in this 
area~\cite{lian2013,van2011,tangelder2008survey,qin2008content}. Note that
different norms may have to be used for different descriptors. 
It is possible that a shape descriptor may incorrectly map contours $c_1$ and 
$c_2$ to the same point even when they have totally different shapes. A good shape descriptor should 
discriminate between different shapes well and reduce the occurrence of such incorrect
mappings. 
\section{Symmetry Detection via Contour Clustering}
Methods based on clustering~\cite{Mitra06,Lip10,MitraGP07,Xu12,RavBBK10,Xu09}
have shown superior performance in detecting
symmetry in shapes. However, directly extending these methods to scalar fields
is non-trivial. In this section, we describe a novel symmetry detection method
based on the idea of clustering contours of the scalar field.
\subsection{Overview}
Figure~\ref{pipeline} illustrates the main steps of our algorithm.
Given a scalar field as input, we generate a set of contours. For each contour
thus generated, a descriptor is computed. The descriptor for each contour
can be considered to be a point in a high dimensional 
descriptor space. The descriptor space is a transformation-invariant space,
i.e., it reverses the effect of geometric transformation on contours. Thus, perfectly
symmetric contours are mapped to the same point in the descriptor space.
Imperfections in symmetry results in imperfections in the mapping.
Since contours with similar shape have similar descriptors,
the points in the descriptor space representing approximately symmetric 
contours will lie in close proximity to each other. Therefore, symmetric contours
can be detected by identifying clusters in the descriptor space. The volumetric
regions represented by the contours within a cluster are then reported as
symmetric regions.

		contours from the region represented by the arc $ac$ of the contour tree
		and the region will not be considered for symmetry analysis.
		On the other hand, a fine sampling of contour may lead to the generation
		of multiple contours from the region represented by the arc $cd$ and
	result in redundant computations. The six contours in~(b) merge in pairs to form
the three contours in~(c). Since the shape of the individual contours before and after the merge is 
very different, two clusters are formed in the descriptor space, one corresponding to the
six contours before merge and the second corresponding to the three contours after merge.}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Contour Generation}\label{congen}
Our algorithm assumes that each region of interest in the domain is represented by a contour belonging to it.
Hence, it is important to use a sampling strategy that generates a contour from each
region of interest. The obvious method for generating contours is 
to sample isovalues uniformly from the range of the function values and extract contours 
corresponding to these isovalues. A coarse uniform sampling may not generate contours 
within a specific region and thus fail to detect it as a symmetric region. On the other hand, 
a fine sampling may generate multiple contours within the same region 
and redundant computations. Ideally, each symmetric region should require only a single 
representative contour for its detection.
The contour tree is a powerful tool that encapsulates information about the evolution of contours~\cite{CarrSP10} 
and we leverage information obtained from the contour tree for optimal generation of contours. 
Each arc of the contour tree represents a family of contours that are nested one inside the other
forming offset surfaces similar to layers of onion peel. Hence, to capture the geometry of the region of 
the domain corresponding to an arc of the contour tree, we select only one contour from each 
arc of the contour tree.

Selecting a representative contour from each arc of the contour tree ensures that no regions
are missed in the subsequent symmetry analysis. However, for noisy scalar fields, a large
number of arcs of the contour tree may correspond to noise. Selecting a contour from each
arc of the contour tree will result in significant amount of computational time spent in
processing these noisy contours and will lead to poor performance. To overcome this problem,
we generate a contour from from an arc of the contour tree only if the arc is is deemed to represent
a feature and not noise. The definition of noise is subjective and depends on the application.
In this work, we consider an arc to be noise if the volume of the 
largest contour associated with the arc is below a user defined threshold $\delta$. The volume of a
contour is approximated as the number of vertices of the domain enclosed by the contour. 
Since each arc of the contour tree can be associated with the set of vertices of the domain 
that comprise the subvolume corresponding to the arc, this estimation of the volume can be done 
efficiently~\cite{CarrSP10}. In the absence of the metadata information provided by the contour tree 
all contours would have had to be treated as equally important. Contour tree driven sampling ensures
that that each region has a representative contour, suppresses generation of multiple contours 
from the same region, and avoids sampling of contours from noisy regions.
\subsection{Contour Representation in Descriptor Space}
Once representative contours are generated from each region of interest, the next step
is to generate a descriptor for each contour. The correspondence score between a pair of
contours is estimated using the distance between their descriptors in the descriptor space.
Designing shape descriptors for matching and retrieving similar shapes is a well studied 
area in the geometry processing community. 
The notion of similarity is subjective and varies from application to application.
One of the major advantages of our method is that it is not tied to a particular choice
of the shape descriptor. Instead, our method offers flexibility in choosing 
the right descriptor for an application.  Hence, our method can be used as a generic framework for detecting 
similar regions in a scalar field. For example, if an application is interested in 
identifying similarity only with respect to rotation, a rotation invariant descriptor may be used. 
The only prerequisite on the descriptor is that it should be discriminative, i.e., contours which are 
similar should be mapped to points that are nearby in the descriptor space while contours that differ 
from each other should be mapped to far away points. Therefore, it is important to use shape descriptors 
with high precision and recall ratios~\cite{lian2013} for applications that cannot tolerate false 
positives during shape retrieval.
\subsection{Contour Clustering}
Shape matching is typically performed on pairs of shapes by comparing the corresponding descriptors. 
Symmetry detection involves identification of a collection of similar contours. Therefore, 
a clustering based approach is more appropriate for this purpose, 
as opposed to an approach based on pairwise comparisons.
As described earlier, the descriptor space is a space in which the contours are represented as 
points in a transformation invariant manner and hence symmetric contours are mapped to points 
that lie in close proximity to each other. As a result, symmetric contours can be easily 
identified as clusters in the descriptor space. Strictly speaking, such a mapping of contours to points in the
descriptor space is not a prerequisite for clustering. A symmetry correspondence
graph can be constructed from a set of contours by representing each contour
as a node in the graph and inserting an edge between two nodes if the corresponding
contours are symmetric. It is easy to see that the contours that are symmetric form
a clique under this representation and these cliques can be identified to detect
symmetric contours~\cite{Lip10}. Thus, the symmetric contours can be directly identified 
from the symmetry correspondence graph and requires only a procedure that assigns a similarity 
correspondence score between pairs of contours for the symmetry correspondence graph construction.
Further processing is performed solely on this graph and is independent
of the actual definition of similarity which may be application dependent. This allows
considerable freedom in choosing a similarity measure that is relevant to an application.
For symmetry detection, distance between points in the descriptor space is 
used to assign the correspondence score between pairs of contours. 

Given a set of contours identified to be symmetric, the arc in the contour tree 
corresponding to each contour can be determined. The region of the domain
enclosed by the largest contour of the arc can then be extracted and reported
as a symmetric region. Although this works well in practice, note that the contour
itself may have evolved due to the merging of contours nested within it, see Figure~\ref{ct-bef-merge}
and~\ref{ct-aft-merge}.
An application with stricter requirements on symmetry detection may need to
also incorporate the symmetry of these nested contours in the algorithm. 
This presents a challenge in directly using clusters in the descriptor space 
for detecting symmetric region because the descriptor space is not continuous with 
respect to the evolution of the shape of a contour during a level set sweep. 
Recall that a cluster in the descriptor space corresponds to a
set of contours with the same shape. As shown in the illustration in 
Figure~\ref{ct-bef-merge} and~\ref{ct-aft-merge}, the shape of each individual nested contour
before merge is totally different different from the shape of each contour after the merge.
Therefore the points corresponding to the contours before and after the merge may not be
part of the same cluster.

	and $q$ respectively. Each edge is weighted with the correspondence score between the
	contours represented by the end points of the edge.}
\end{figure}

To address this issue, we incorporate the correspondence score between the children contours 
(contours before merging) while calculating the correspondence score between a given pair
of parent contours (contours after merging). Let $p$ and $q$ be two parent contours
with children contours ${c_1}^p,\dots,{c_n}^p$ and ${c_1}^q,\dots,{c_m}^q$ respectively. 
Assume that the correspondence score between any two
children contours ${c_i}^p$ and ${c_j}^q$ is known - for contours with children,
the procedure below can be applied bottom up to determine their correspondence
while for contours that do not have children, the correspondence score can be directly 
determined from the descriptor space. To calculate the correspondence score
between $p$ and $q$, first the contribution from the children contours 
is determined. We construct a bipartite graph where nodes in the first
and second partitions are ${c_1}^p,\dots,{c_n}^p$ and ${c_1}^q,\dots,{c_m}^q$ 
respectively, see Figure~\ref{bip}. An edge between ${c_i}^p$ and ${c_j}^q$ is weighted
with the correspondence score between ${c_i}^p$ and ${c_j}^q$. The maximum weight
matching can then be computed and gives the correspondence score between the children
contours. The correspondence score between the contours $p$ and $q$ obtained
directly from the descriptor space is added to the maximum weight matching score
and used as the cumulative correspondence score between $p$ and $q$. 
\section{Implementation}
In the previous section, we described the generic details of our symmetry
detection algorithm. In this section, we elaborate on the details of our 
implementation of the algorithm.
\subsection{Isovalue Selection}
In Section~\ref{congen}, we explained that the contour tree facilitates smart
sampling of contours by selecting a contour from each arc of the contour tree
that is not deemed as noise. Each arc of the contour tree encodes the range
of values of the scalar field restricted to the subdomain represented by the arc.
The question that remains is which function value in this range should be used
to generate the representative contour for the arc. Rather than selecting any 
value, it is beneficial to employ a stability criterion and select the
maximally stable contour from each arc~\cite{MatasCUP04}. This ensures consistency
in the shape of the contours extracted from different regions that are symmetric.
The important observation here is that the contours within the same arc
may undergo changes to its shape just before (or soon after) it merges 
with another contour at a saddle. Similarly, the shape of the contour in the
immediate neighbourhood of an extremum is typically very small and undergoes
changes as it evolves into a bigger contour.

%			$lm$ = Q.pop()\\
%		}
%	}
%	\caption{\label{samalgo}{

%			lies in between $f(l)$ and $f(m)$ but is not too close to either $f(l)$ or $f(m)$, 
%			then a contour is extracted at isovalue $w$ for all arcs that satisfy the criterion. 
%			When an arc does not satisfy the criterion, the process is repeated with a new isovalue $w$.}
%}
%\end{algorithm}

For the purpose of computational efficiency, we adopt a simple strategy
based on the above observation that contours in the immediate vicinity
of a saddle or an extremum are not stable. A parameter $\alpha$ is chosen
such that for each arc $lm$ the isovalue $w$ satisfies the condition
$f(m)+\alpha \leq w \leq f(l)-\alpha$, assuming $f(l) > f(m)$. In other words,
the isovalue $w$ is chosen such that it is not too close to either
$f(l)$ or $f(m)$. It is important
to note that the exact value of $\alpha$ is not critical because within an arc,
only those contours generated from isovalues that are very close to an extremum or
saddle may undergo significant changes in shape. Therefore, the exact value of $\alpha$
is not important as long as it is not set to a value too close to zero.
In our experiments we set $\alpha$ to 1\% of the range of the function values. 
%Consider a level set sweep in the increasing order of function values.
%The saddle at which a contour, created at a minimum, merge
%into another contour is called a join saddle. The algorithm is described
%for join saddles and arcs incident on join saddles. A split saddle is defined
%analogously by reversing the direction of the sweep and a similar algorithm
%is used to generate contours corresponding to arcs incident on the split saddles.
%The algorithm considers each join saddle $s_i$ in the decreasing order of function
%values. It then generates an isovalue $w = f(s_i)-\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a
%parameter chosen to ensure that $w$ is not too close to $f(s_i)$. It is important
%to note that the exact value of $\alpha$ is not critical because within an arc,
%only those contours generated from isovalues that are very close to an extremum or
%saddle may undergo significant changes in shape. In our experiments we set $\alpha$
%to 1\% of the range of the function values. Next, each non-noisy arc $lm$ 
%incident on a join saddle is considered. If $w$ lies between $f(l)$ and $f(m)$ but not 
%too close to either $f(l)$ or $f(m)$, i.e., $f(m)+\alpha <= w <= f(l)-\alpha$, 
%then a contour is generated at the isovalue $w$ from the arc $lm$.
%
\subsection{Shape Descriptor}
As described, the choice of shape descriptor depends on the kind of similarity
analysis required by an application. For symmetry detection, we use the 
Laplace-Beltrami spectra as the shape descriptor. The descriptor has been used for 
shape matching and retrieval and is robust in the 
presence of noise, deformations in shape, and differences in the underlying 
triangulation~\cite{reuter2006laplace,niethammer2007global,reuter2009laplace}. 
Although it is possible that two different shapes may have the same spectra,
it is very rare in practice~\cite{reuter2006laplace} and is the descriptor is 
quite discriminative
with high precision and recall ratios~\cite{lian2013}. We use the popular cotangent
weighted scheme for computing the Laplace-Beltrami spectra~\cite{PinkallP93}.
Computation of the Laplace-Beltrami spectra on large meshes is costly and therefore
we simplify the contour meshes so that the number of vertices in the mesh is around 1000.
\subsection{Clustering}\label{clust}
The distance between the points in the descriptor space is used to assign 
a correspondence score between the contours they represent. Let $c_i$
and $c_j$ be two contours that belong to the same level set and $d$ be
the distance between their descriptors. The ideal metric for computing
distances in the descriptor space may be determined using methods like
metric learning~\cite{Kulis13}, however, we use
Euclidean distances since it has yielded good results with shape 
retrieval~\cite{reuter2006laplace,lian2013}. We build a symmetry
correspondence matrix, $\mathrm{S}$, where the entry $s_{ij}$ of the
matrix denotes the correspondence score between the contours $c_i$
and $c_j$.
$$s_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
	e^{-\frac{d^2}{\sigma}} & \text{if $c_i$ and $c_j$ belong to the same level set}\\
	0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
Here, $\sigma$ is a user defined parameter that controls the quality of symmetry detected
where higher values of $\sigma$ tolerate larger deviations in symmetry. We use spectral clustering
to identify clusters of symmetric contours from $\mathrm{S}$. As described by 
Lipman~et~al.~\cite{Lip10}, spectral clustering is well suited for identifying
cliques in the symmetry correspondence graph and clusters of symmetric
contours can be detected from their spectral coordinates. Any standard clustering
method may be used to detect the clusters. We observe that the clusters
are well separated in the spectral domain and for a given contour, we identify
the set of contours symmetric to it with a simple nearest neighbour search.
\section{Applications}
It is easy to see that our method can be used to demonstrate the existing
applications of identifying symmetry in scalar fields reported earlier
in the literature. In this section, we describe two new applications
for improving exploration and visualization of scalar fields.
\subsection{Query Driven Exploration Using Contours}
As the size and complexity of data generated through imaging and simulations
grows, newer paradigms for effective exploration and interaction with
the data are required. Query driven exploration is one such paradigm that
facilitates navigation through complex data and is gaining popularity in recent
years~\cite{BeyerAKLPH13,LiuJH13}. Symmetry regions in a dataset facilitate query
driven exploration of the data~\cite{ThomN13,MasoodTN13}. A region of interest that is segmented from 
the domain is used as the query region and symmetry information is used to identify

other regions similar to the query. To drive exploration using regions of the domain as query, the domain 
needs to be segmented and this is often a challenge. Instead, it is significantly more easy to visualize the
evolution of contours during a level set sweep and select a contour of interest. 
We demonstrate that our method can be used to explore datasets using a contour as the query object.

A simulation of the hurricane Isabel, which struck the west Atlantic in 2003, was performed
on a 500$\times$500$\times$100 grid over 48 time steps. Figure~\ref{volisa1} shows a volume rendering
of the first time step where the scalar field used is pressure and the low pressure region
is shown in red. A domain expert with the knowledge that isocontours in the low pressure region
roughly has the shape of a hemisphere can use a synthetically generated shape, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{gaus}, as the query object. We generate a scale invariant version of the Laplace-Beltrami
spectra by dividing all the eigen values with the first non-zero eigen value. The scale invariant
descriptor for the query object is then computed. Next, our method generates different contours of the 
volume and compute their scale invariant descriptors. The nearest neighbour of the descriptor 
representing the query object is then searched in the descriptor space. We identify the contour
shown in Figure~\ref{conisa1} through this search. Note that the size and the exact shape of the
query object is different from that of the contour identified.
The descriptor is robust to these variations and therefore the query successfully identifies 
a contour from the low pressure region. The volumetric region of the domain from which the contour
is generated, shown in yellow, is extracted and displayed in the context of the rest of the volume in 
Figure~\ref{detisa1}. 

We demonstrate querying with
a synthetic shape to establish the power of the descriptor space as a geometry based representation 
of the scalar field, but we concede that using a synthetic shape as query object may not be always 
possible. What is more useful is to select one of the contours from a region of interest as the query
object. It is straightforward to see that this approach may be used
to navigate through regions of interest within the same dataset similar to earlier approaches~\cite{ThomN13,MasoodTN13}.
What is more interesting is that the same approach can be extended to search through multiple datasets.
By using the contour, shown in Figure~\ref{conisa1}, from the first time step  as the query object, we search through 
the rest of the time steps and the contours detected as a result of executing the query on four different 
steps is shown in Figure~\ref{conisa12}-~\ref{conisa48}. Observe that
the contours show variations in their shape and has considerable amount of noise. 
Also, as opposed to the query contour, a significant portion
of the mouth of the contour is closed in Figure~\ref{conisa48} as the hurricane makes landfall.
Even with these challenges, the query is successful and emphasizes the robustness of our method.
The volumetric region of the domain extracted in each case is shown in yellow in the context of the rest
of the volume in Figure~\ref{volisa12}-~\ref{volisa48}.
\subsection{Asymmetry Visualization}
Asymmetry in scalar fields often reveals crucial characteristics of the underlying
physical phenomena. For example, asymmetry between 
the left and the right breasts in the mammogram images is an indicator of breast 
cancer~\cite{tahmoush2007improved}. Therefore, the study of asymmetry plays a vital role 
in understanding the characteristics of symmetric regions in scalar fields.

(c)~The top contour is aligned with the bottom contour and a distance field is computed. (d)~Asymmetric regions

\end{figure*}

Given a set of contours $c_1,\dots,c_n$, marked as symmetric
by our algorithm, we determine asymmetry of contour $c_k$, $1 \leq k \leq n$, with
respect to the set of remaining contours $S = \{c_1, \dots, c_{k-1}, c_{k+1}, \dots, c_n\}$.
For this, we first determine the symmetry transformation that maps each $c_i \in S$ onto
$c_k$ and spatially align $c_i$ with $c_k$ by applying the transformation. 
The transformation may be determined using a procedure like ICP (Iterative Closest Point).
These spatially aligned meshes in $S$ are then glued together to generate a single mesh, say $c_{avg}$, 
with respect to which asymmetry of $c_k$ is determined. For this purpose, we use the 
\texttt{Metro} tool~\cite{CigRS98} which evaluates the distance from the vertices of the mesh 
$c_k$ to the mesh $c_{avg}$ by computing for each vertex in $c_k$ the closest point in $c_{avg}$. 
If the distance for a vertex is high, it means that there
was no point corresponding to it in the rest of the contours which is an indication of asymmetry.
Note that the tool cannot compute distances between contours directly from their original
spatial coordinates as it requires both the meshes to be spatially aligned. 
The distance computed at each vertex using \texttt{Metro} is stored as a scalar field of 
$c_k$ and the procedure is repeated
for each contour. The asymmetry in the contours can then be located by visualizing the distance fields
as shown in Figure~\ref{asym}.

%\subsection{PDF Generation}
%
%Your final paper should be delivered as a PDF document with all typefaces
%embedded. \LaTeX{} users should use \texttt{dvips} and \texttt{ps2pdf} to
%create this PDF document. Adobe Acrobat Distiller may be used in place of
%\texttt{ps2pdf}.
%
%Adobe PDFWriter is \emph{not} acceptable for use. Documents created with
%PDFWriter will be returned to the author for revision. \texttt{pdftex} and
%\texttt{pdflatex} (and its variants) can be used only if the author can
%make certain that all typefaces are embedded and images are not downsampled
%or subsampled during the PDF creation process.
%
%Users with no access to these PDF creation tools should make available a
%PostScript file and we will make a PDF document from it.
%
%
%The PDF file \emph{must not} be change protected.
%
%%------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsubsection*{Configuration Notes: dvips / ps2pdf / etc.}
%
%\noindent
%\texttt{dvips} should be invoked with the \texttt{-Ppdf} and \texttt{-G0}
%flags in order to use Type 1 PostScript typefaces:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%    dvips -t a4 -Ppdf -G0 -o my.ps my.dvi
%\end{verbatim}
%
%
%\noindent
%If you are using version 7.x of GhostScript, please use the following method of invoking \texttt{ps2pdf}, in
%order to embed all typefaces and ensure that images are not downsampled or subsampled in the PDF
%creation process:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%  ps2pdf -dMaxSubsetPct=100 \
%         -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 \
%         -dSubsetFonts=true \
%         -dEmbedAllFonts=true \
%         -dAutoFilterColorImages=false \
%         -dAutoFilterGrayImages=false \
%         -dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%         -dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%         -dMonoImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%         mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
%\end{verbatim}
%
%
%If you are using version 8.x of GhostScript, please use this method in place of the example above:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress \
%         -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 \
%         -dAutoFilterColorImages=false \
%         -dAutoFilterGrayImages=false \
%         -dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%         -dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%         -dMonoImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%         -dDownsampleColorImages=false \
%         -dDownsampleGrayImages=false \
%         mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
%\end{verbatim}
%
%%------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsubsection*{Configuration Notes: pdftex / pdflatex / etc.}
%
%\noindent
%Configuration of these tools to embed all typefaces can be accomplished by editing the \texttt{updmap.cfg} file
%to enable inclusion of the standard (or base) 14 typefaces.
%
%Linux users can run the \texttt{updmap} script to do this:
%\begin{verbatim}
%updmap --setoption pdftexDownloadBase14 true
%\end{verbatim}
%
%Windows users should edit the \texttt{updmap.cfg} files found in their TeX installation directories (one or both
%of the following may be present):
%\begin{verbatim}
%  INSTALLDIR\texmf\web2c\updmap.cfg
%  INSTALLDIR\localtexmf\miktex\config\updmap.cfg
%\end{verbatim}
%
%Ensure the value for \texttt{pdftexDownloadBase14} is "true," and then follow the instructions found here:
%\httpAddr{//docs.miktex.org/manual/} to update your MikTeX installation.
%
%%------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsubsection*{Configuration Notes: Acrobat Distiller}
%
%We recommend to download and install the version of the ``CMW'' Adobe Acrobat Distiller job options file
%appropriate for your operating system and version of Acrobat from the following URL:
%
%\httpAddr{//www.cadmusmediaworks.com/index2.html}\\
%in the ``(Operating System)/Applications/Distiller Settings'' folder. The ``CMW'' job options file embeds
%all typefaces and does not downsample or subsample images when creating the PDF document.
%%------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsection{Copyright forms}
%
%You must include your signed Eurographics copyright release form
%when you submit your finished paper. We MUST have this form before
%your paper can be published in the proceedings.
