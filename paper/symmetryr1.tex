\firstsection{Introduction}
\maketitle
Many scientific experiments and simulations generate scalar field data and 
they often contain symmetric or repeating patterns. In many disciplines, 
symmetry plays an important role in studying the underlying scientific phenomena. 
For example, in crystallography, symmetry information is used to determine 
the structure of a crystal. In product design, symmetry is important to ensure
functional efficiency and optimal manufacturing cost. Symmetry is a 
useful cue in bilogoy for determining growth and development of organs. Since 
the study of symmetric features is of great interest in scientific data 
analysis, the problem of detecting symmetry in scalar fields has received 
considerable attention among researchers in the recent past.

Automatic detection of symmetry in scalar fields is a challenging problem and 
the quest for a widely applicable, efficient, and robust method for symmetry 
detection has remained largely unanswered. Though symmetry detection in scalar
fields is a relatively new area of research, the problem of detecting symmetry
in shapes has been well studied in the geometry processing community.
These studies have established that clustering based analysis show superior
performance in robust identification of symmetry. Although some of the methods
that use clustering for detecting symmetry in shapes have been extended to
scalar fields also, these methods operate by determining symmetry
transformations through aggregation of local symmetry of sample points of the
domain. Since sample points in a scalar field capture information at a
microscale granularity, these methods face difficulties in extracting and
representing symmetric regions and are also computationally inefficient.

In this work, we propose a novel symmetry detection method based on the idea of
clustering contours. We believe that contours capture information about a
scalar field at a macroscale as opposed to points of the domain and hence they
are a more meaningful entity for performing a clustering based analysis for
symmetry detection. Existing methods that use clustering for detecting symmetry
in scalar fields are based on determining symmetry transformations which is 
computationally expensive. Our method, on the other hand, maps contours as
points in a descriptor space such that similar contours lie in close proximity
to each other.  Thus, the distance between points in the descriptor space 
captures similarity relationship between the contours and clusters in the 
descriptor space can be used to determine symmetric regions as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{teaser}. 

The main contributions of this paper are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Modelling the problem of symmetry detection in scalar fields
as a clustering problem in a shape descriptor space. This model
provides a lot of flexibility in similarity analysis of scalar fields
as it allows the shape representation and the descriptor space to be varied.
\item The mapping of contours to points in a contour descriptor space is a novel
representation that captures similarity information about the contours of a 
scalar field. This is a powerful representation not just for symmetry identification
within a scalar field, but also for any kind of similarity analysis on different
scalar fields.
\item An algorithm to detect symmetric regions in a scalar field. Our algorithm
can detect symmetry at multiple scales and we demonstrate the results of our algorithm
on different datasets.
\item Applicatsions
\end{itemize}
Symmetry information in scalar fields
has been used for transfer function design, exploration of isosurfaces, selection of cross-section
planes and view directions, linked selection and editing, query driven exploration
and visualization of features through dual rendering~\cite{}.
We believe that as better techniques for robust detection of symmetry in scalar fields emerge,
many more applications of symmetry detection will be explored in the future.
\section{Related Work}
Existing symmetry detection methods in scalar fields can be broadly classified into two
categories, namely, gemoetry based methods and topology based methods. We briefly review
these methods in this section.
\subsection{Geometry based approaches}
Several methods have been proposed in the literature for detecting
symmetry in shapes and these methods are described in a survery paper by
Mitra~et~al.~\cite{}. Some of these methods~\cite{} have been applied to scalar fields~\cite{},
however they struggle to address the challenges in extending geometric methods to scalar fields.
Scalar field datasets are typically large in size and hence symmetry detection is computationally costly.
Geometric methods typically consider geometric information derived from a small region in isolation 
for symmetry detection. This makes it difficult to infer importance of 
features in a scalar field and hence these methods perform poorly in handling noisy scalar fields.  
Moreover, the scalar values are assumed to be continuous over the domain by interpolating the values at 
the discrete set of points. Since the symmetric counterpart for a given point may be an interpolated 
point, it is important to consider scalar values of the interpolated points.

Hong and Shen~\cite{} propose a method to detect global reflective symmetry by identifying planes
of reflections that minimize the difference between the scalar value at a point and its
reflection. This method is computationally inefficient and cannot be easily extended to detect 
other types of symmetry. Kerber~et~al.~\cite{} build a graph from crease line features in a dataset
and use graph matching to detect symmetry. Since only a small subset of features in scalar field datasets
contain crease lines, this method is not very useful in practice. Masood~et~al.\cite{} detect
symmetry by identify symmetry transformations as clusters in the space of all transformations
by aggregating local symmetry transformations of pairs of points in the domain. This method relies
on local signatures of the grid points for determining symmetry transformations and as a result
several parameters need to be tweaked at various stages of the symmetry detection pipeline
to limit the adverse effects of variations in the local signatures and interpolation errors.  
Moreover, the transformation space is often cluttered with a lot of spurious transformations 
and introduces artifacts in the extraction of symmetric regions from the point set. 

The above methods compute geometric transformations between candidate pairs for identifying
symmetry and is computationally costly. Moreover, these methods being purely driven by local geometric 
information, do not incorporate any notion of importance of a feature and require every candidate pair 
to be equally important in their analysis. Our method, on the other hand, uses topological
information derived from the contour tree to infer importance of a feature and this allows the
design of a ``feature size sensitive" algorithm from symmetry detection.
\subsection{Topology based methods}
Thomas and Natarajan propose topology based methods for symmetry detection and these methods 
are computationally efficient because they operate on graph representations of the scalar field
like the contour tree~\cite{} and the extremum graph~\cite{}. The contour tree based method 
assumes that the subtrees of the contour tree corresponding to symmetric regions are structurally
similar and detect symmetry by evaluating structural similarity between the subtrees using a 
similarity score. This method can detect symmetry at multiple scales but cannot handle
noise in scalar fields that destroy the repeating structure of the subtrees. To address
this issue, the extremum graph based method selects a set of extrema called seed set and 
estimates distances robustly through a graph traversal procedure. A carefully chosen distance 
threshold is used to disconnect the graph and classify the seeds into different groups called 
super-seeds. A region growing procedure is then used to identify the symmetric region 
corresponding to each super-seed. This procedure makes a strong assumption that the symmetric regions
can be identified purely from the proximity relationship between the seeds. Hence,
it relies heavily on a meaningful selection of seed set which involves significant effort 
and understanding about the symmetry of the domain and also requires several thresholds
to be set.

The above two methods being topological in nature do not ensure that the regions detected by
them are indeed geometrically symmetric and this is a major shortcoming of these methods.
Since our method is geometric in nature, it ensures that the regions detected are symmetric.
Moreover, by utilizing the power of contour tree as a topological abstraction that represents
the contours of a scalar field, our method offers significant advantage over existing geometry
based symmetry detection methods. The contour tree provides metadata information about the contours
and allows integration of topological information in geometric processing and results in smarter
processing of the contours.
\section{Definitions}
Consider a \emph{scalar field}, $f : \mathbb{M}  \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, defined on a 
simply connected domain $\mathbb{M}$. The preimage of $f$ for a given value $u \in \mathbb{R}$, 
$f^{-1}(u)$, is called a \emph{level set} of $f$. A level set may have multiple components
and each component is called a \emph{contour}. The \emph{contour tree} is a topological 
data structure that captures the change in the connectivity of the level sets during a 
sweep of $f$. Consider the following equivalence relation defined on points in $\mathbb{M}$: $x,y 
\in \mathbb{M}$ are equivalent if they belong to the same contour. The contour
tree is the quotient space induced by this relation. 

Subdomains $\mathbb{M}_1, \mathbb{M}_2 \subseteq \mathbb{M}$ are said to be \emph{symmetric} 
if there is a transformation $T$ such that ${\mathbb{M}_2=T(\mathbb{M}_1)}$ and 
${f(x)=f(T(x))}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{M}_1$. If $c_1$ and $c_2$ are contours that belong to 
$\mathbb{M}_1$ and $\mathbb{M}_2$ respectively, it is easy to see that if $\mathbb{M}_1$ and 
$\mathbb{M}_2$ are symmetric then $c_1$ and $c_2$ are also symmetric. We make use of this property
and detect symmetric subdomains by identifying symmetry of the contours belonging to
the subdomains. The above definition of symmetry requires computation of the symmetry 
transformation $T$ which is a costly operation. Let $\mathbb{C}$ be the set of all contours. 
Consider a function $g : \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $g(c) = g(T(c))$
where $T$ is any transformation. In other words, $g$ is a function that maps each
contour to a point in a high dimensional space such that a contour and any symmetric
copy of it is mapped to the same point. We call this high dimensional space
\emph{descriptor space}. Thus, if $c_1$ and $c_2$ are perfectly symmetric
the distance between them in the descriptor space is zero, i.e., 
$\lVert g(c_1)-g(c_2) \rVert = 0$. 

In practice, scalar field datasets do not exhibit perfect symmetry and therefore
it is important to detect symmetry in an approximate sense. If contours $c_1$ and 
$c_2$ deviate from perfect symmetry, then $c_1$ and $c_2$ will not be mapped
to the same point in the descriptor space and the distance between
them in the descriptor space, $\lVert g(c_1)-g(c_2) \rVert$ will be indicative
of the deviation from perfect symmetry. We say that $c_2$ is \emph{$\epsilon$-symmetric} 
with respect to $c_1$ if the distance of $c_2$ from $c_1$ in the descriptor 
space is less than $\epsilon$, i.e., $\lVert g(c_1)-g(c_2) \rVert < \epsilon$.

%Due to the use of the package \texttt{hyperref} the original behavior

%\subsubsection*{Configuration Notes: pdftex / pdflatex / etc.}
%
%\noindent
%Configuration of these tools to embed all typefaces can be accomplished by editing the \texttt{updmap.cfg} file
%to enable inclusion of the standard (or base) 14 typefaces.
%
%Linux users can run the \texttt{updmap} script to do this:
%\begin{verbatim}
%updmap --setoption pdftexDownloadBase14 true
%\end{verbatim}
%
%Windows users should edit the \texttt{updmap.cfg} files found in their TeX installation directories (one or both
%of the following may be present):
%\begin{verbatim}
%  INSTALLDIR\texmf\web2c\updmap.cfg
%  INSTALLDIR\localtexmf\miktex\config\updmap.cfg
%\end{verbatim}
%
%Ensure the value for \texttt{pdftexDownloadBase14} is "true," and then follow the instructions found here:
%\httpAddr{//docs.miktex.org/manual/} to update your MikTeX installation.

%\subsubsection*{Configuration Notes: Acrobat Distiller}
%
%We recommend to download and install the version of the ``CMW'' Adobe Acrobat Distiller job options file
%appropriate for your operating system and version of Acrobat from the following URL:
%
%\httpAddr{//www.cadmusmediaworks.com/index2.html}\\
%in the ``(Operating System)/Applications/Distiller Settings'' folder. The ``CMW'' job options file embeds
%all typefaces and does not downsample or subsample images when creating the PDF document.
