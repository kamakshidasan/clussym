%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many scientific experiments and simulations generate scalar field data and 
they often contain symmetric or repeating patterns. In many disciplines, 
symmetry plays an important role in studying the underlying scientific phenomena. 
For example, in crystallography, symmetry information is used to determine 
the structure of a crystal. In product design, symmetry is important to ensure
functional efficiency and optimal manufacturing cost. Symmetry is a 
useful cue in bilogoy for determining growth and development of organs. Since 
the study of symmetric features is of great interest in scientific data 
analysis, the problem of detecting symmetry in scalar fields has received 
considerable attention among researchers in the recent past.

Automatic detection of symmetry in scalar fields is a challenging problem and 
the quest for a widely applicable, efficient, and robust method for symmetry 
detection has remained largely unanswered. Though symmetry detection in scalar
fields is a relatively new area of research, the problem of detecting symmetry
in shapes has been well studied in the geometry processing community.
These studies have established that clustering based analysis show superior
performance in robust identification of symmetry. Although some of the methods
that use clustering for detecting symmetry in shapes have been extended to
scalar fields also, these methods operate by determining symmetry
transformations through aggregation of local symmetry of sample points of the
domain. Since sample points in a scalar field capture information at a
microscale granularity, these methods face difficulties in extracting and
representing symmetric regions and are also computationally inefficient.

In this work, we propose a novel symmetry detection method based on the idea of
clustering contours. We believe that contours capture information about a
scalar field at a macroscale as opposed to points of the domain and hence they
are a more meaningful entity for performing a clustering based analysis for
symmetry detection. Existing methods that use clustering for detecting symmetry
in scalar fields are based on determining symmetry transformations which is 
computationally expensive. Our method, on the other hand, maps contours as
points in a descriptor space such that similar contours lie in close proximity
to each other.  Thus, the distance between points in the descriptor space 
captures similarity relationship between the contours and clusters in the 
descriptor space can be used to determine symmetric regions as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{teaser}. 

The main contributions of this paper are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Modelling the problem of symmetry detection in scalar fields
as a clustering problem in a shape descriptor space. This model
provides a lot of flexibility in similarity analysis of scalar fields
as it allows the shape representation and the descriptor space to be varied.
\item The mapping of contours to points in a contour descriptor space is a novel
representation that captures similarity information about the contours of a 
scalar field. This is a powerful representation not just for symmetry identification
within a scalar field, but also for any kind of similarity analysis on different
scalar fields.
\item An algorithm to detect symmetric regions in a scalar field. Our algorithm
can detect symmetry at multiple scales and we demonstrate the results of our algorithm
on different datasets.
\item Applicatsions
\end{itemize}
Symmetry information in scalar fields
has been used for transfer function design, exploration of isosurfaces, selection of cross-section
planes and view directions, linked selection and editing, query driven exploration
and visualization of features through dual rendering~\cite{}.
We believe that as better techniques for robust detection of symmetry in scalar fields emerge,
many more applications of symmetry detection will be explored in the future.

\section{Related Work}
Existing symmetry detection methods in scalar fields can be broadly classified into two
categories, namely, gemoetry based methods and topology based methods. We briefly review
these methods in this section.
\subsection{Geometry based approaches}
Several methods have been proposed in the literature for detecting
symmetry in shapes and these methods are described in a survery paper by
Mitra~et~al.~\cite{}. Some of these methods~\cite{} have been applied to scalar fields~\cite{},
however they struggle to address the challenges in extending geometric methods to scalar fields.
Scalar field datasets are typically large in size and hence symmetry detection is computationally costly.
Geometric methods typically consider geometric information derived from a small region in isolation 
for symmetry detection. This makes it difficult to infer importance of 
features in a scalar field and hence these methods perform poorly in handling noisy scalar fields.  
Moreover, the scalar values are assumed to be continuous over the domain by interpolating the values at 
the discrete set of points. Since the symmetric counterpart for a given point may be an interpolated 
point, it is important to consider scalar values of the interpolated points.

Hong and Shen~\cite{} propose a method to detect global reflective symmetry by identifying planes
of reflections that minimize the difference between the scalar value at a point and its
reflection. This method is computationally inefficient and cannot be easily extended to detect 
other types of symmetry. Kerber~et~al.~\cite{} build a graph from crease line features in a dataset
and use graph matching to detect symmetry. Since only a small subset of features in scalar field datasets
contain crease lines, this method is not very useful in practice. Masood~et~al.\cite{} detect
symmetry by identify symmetry transformations as clusters in the space of all transformations
by aggregating local symmetry transformations of pairs of points in the domain. This method relies
on local signatures of the grid points for determining symmetry transformations and as a result
several parameters need to be tweaked at various stages of the symmetry detection pipeline
to limit the adverse effects of variations in the local signatures and interpolation errors.  
Moreover, the transformation space is often cluttered with a lot of spurious transformations 
and introduces artifacts in the extraction of symmetric regions from the point set. 

The above methods compute geometric transformations between candidate pairs for identifying
symmetry and is computationally costly. Moreover, these methods being purely driven by local geometric 
information, do not incorporate any notion of importance of a feature and require every candidate pair 
to be equally important in their analysis. Our method, on the other hand, uses topological
information derived from the contour tree to infer importance of a feature and this allows the
design of a ``feature size sensitive" algorithm from symmetry detection.
\subsection{Topology based methods}
Thomas and Natarajan propose topology based methods for symmetry detection and these methods 
are computationally efficient because they operate on graph representations of the scalar field
like the contour tree~\cite{} and the extremum graph~\cite{}. The contour tree based method 
assumes that the subtrees of the contour tree corresponding to symmetric regions are structurally
similar and detect symmetry by evaluating structural similarity between the subtrees using a scoring
function.


%\noindent{\textbf{Advantages over contour tree.}} Our method has significant advantages over 
%the symmetry detection method proposed recently by Thomas and Natarajan, which is 
%based on detecting similar subtrees of the branch decomposition representation of 
%the contour tree~\cite{ThomN11}. Since branches corresponding to noise in the data can destroy 
%the similarity of the subtrees, their method requires the removal of such branches. For this purpose, 
%the branch decomposition is simplified by removing low persistence branches under the assumption that 
%only low amplitude noise exists in the data. Though our method also simplifies the extremum graph for 
%computational efficiency, in contrast to the assumption made by the contour tree based method, we do not necessarily
%require that the noise is removed through the simplification step. As described above, the presence of noise does not 
%affect the distance calculation and hence our method can handle noise of larger amplitude in the data.
%Moreover, our method incorporates geometric information for more effective symmetry detection and also uses a region 
%growing procedure to identify the largest symmetric 
%region. In comparison, the method by Thomas and Natarajan ignores geometric information and does not necessarily
%identify the largest symmetric region.
%In Fig.~\ref{extterrain}, depending on the noise in the data, the branches corresponding to the noisy hills
%can merge with the branches corresponding to the mountains in an arbitrary manner.
%The violet and the blue subtrees in Fig.~\ref{terrain-bd} 
%show the branch decomposition representation of the symmetric regions in Fig.~\ref{extterrain}.
%Note that the two subtrees are quite different and hence the subtree matching method cannot
%identify the symmetric regions.
%We illustrate this further with a real-world dataset in Section~\ref{resanddis}.
%In this section, we first present an overview of the proposed method by describing the
%different stages in the symmetry detection pipeline. Next, we describe the core of the pipeline, 
%namely traversal of the augmented extremum graph and formation of super-seeds. \subsection{Overview}
%of detecting symmetry in scalar fields and we believe that several more applications will be
%explored in the future, not only for visualization, but also for specific domains
%that can exploit symmetry information.

%
%To determine the optimum size (width and height) of an image, measure

%Due to the use of the package \texttt{hyperref} the original behavior

%  % the following command controls the width of the embedded PS file

%  \includegraphics[width=.3\linewidth]{sampleFig}
%  % replacing the above command with the one below will explicitly set
%  % the bounding box of the PS figure to the rectangle (xl,yl),(xh,yh).
%  % It will also prevent LaTeX from reading the PS file to determine
%  % the bounding box (i.e., it will speed up the compilation process)

%           color throughout the paper) please \textbf{observe}: 
%           for the printed version -- and ONLY for the printed
%           version -- color figures have to be placed in the last page.

%           For the electronic version, which will be converted to PDF before
%           making it available electronically, the color images should be
%           embedded within the document. Optionally, other multimedia
%           material may be attached to the electronic version. }
